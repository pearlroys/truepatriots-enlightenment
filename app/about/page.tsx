            <p>
              In January 2018, former United States President Donald Trump was
              reported to have referred to African countries, Haiti and El
              Salvador as “shithole countries.” In 2019, similar remarks were
              attributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
            </p>

            <p>
              These comments exposed uncomfortable truths and sparked deep
              reflection on governance, corruption, leadership failures and the
              absence of true patriotism across Africa.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than demanding apologies, the founder believed Africa needed
              introspection, character reformation and a renewed commitment to
              integrity and civic responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the 1st of April 2021, this conviction gave birth to the True
              Patriots Enlightenment and Empowerment Organization.
