          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            In January 2018, former United States President Donald Trump was widely reported
            to have described African countries, Haiti and El Salvador as shithole countries.
          </p>
  
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            The statement triggered widespread reflection across Africa and the diaspora,
            raising difficult questions about governance, corruption and leadership
            accountability.
          </p>
  
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            These reflections led to the establishment of True Patriots Enlightenment and
            Empowerment Organization on 1st April 2021, with a commitment to promote
            patriotism, integrity and responsible citizenship.
